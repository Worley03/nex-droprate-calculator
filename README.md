This plugin monitors the players contribution to Nex fights and continuously calculates the roll for a unique drop.

Overview of the monitored properties:
- Unique Chance: The percent chance to receive an unique drop.
- Unique Roll: The roll that is made to receive an unique drop.
- Contribution Per.: The percent of the damage you have contributed to the fight.
- Contribution Flat: The damage you have contributed to the fight and the total damage that was made by all players.
- Contribution Min.: Indicates if enough damage was contributed to receive at least a normal drop.
- Players: The amount of players that fought Nex. Players will die or leave, so the number can decrease, to get an average idea of how many players participated
- Is MVP: Indicates if the player was MVP or not.
- Time: The time it took to fight Nex (This differs a bit from the chat time, because it monitors from model appear to model disappear.)

In the average section, runs that were not canceled are calculated together to receive an average. It can be used to monitor how you do over a course of time and how likely you are to receive unique drops. We have some more properties here:
- Total Runs: The amount of runs that were calculated to an average.
- MVP Total: The total times the player was MVP.
- Runs/hr: A rough estimate how many runs you can do per hour, excluding banking and restock time, but includes respawn time.
- Uniques Chance/hr: Based on Runs/hr and average unique chance.
