Calculates and tracks:
- Unique Chance %: The percent chance to receive an unique drop.
- Unique Roll: The roll that is made to receive an unique drop.
- Contribution %: The percent of the damage you have contributed to the fight. Green is above average, red is below.
- Contribution Flat: The damage you have contributed to the fight and the total damage that was made by all players.
- Contribution Minimum: Indicates if enough damage was contributed to receive at least a normal drop.
- Players: The amount of players that fought Nex.
- Is MVP: Indicates if the player was MVP or not.
- Time: The time it took to fight Nex (This differs a bit from the chat time, because it monitors from model appear to model disappear.)
- Averages: Lists averages of stats above throughout session.
